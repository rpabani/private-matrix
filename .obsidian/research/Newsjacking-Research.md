## 1. OpenAI o3-mini & Deep Research Launch

**EXP Angle:** Competitive intelligence and corporate strategy. "Deep Research" shifts the burden of multi-step procurement or market analysis from humans to autonomous agents. Firms can now generate 30-page due diligence reports in 10 minutes, drastically reducing "time-to-decision" for investment banks and strategy teams.
**DREAMS Angle:** AI Literacy. The launch of o3-mini for free users levels the playing field for high-tier reasoning. 1:1 coaching should focus on "Agentic Thinking"—how to prompt a model that can browse and self-correct—rather than just "Chatting."

## 2. The DeepSeek-R1 Efficiency Shockwave

**EXP Angle:** Cost reduction and sovereign AI. DeepSeek's $6M training cost vs. OpenAI's billions is forcing enterprise leaders to rethink "Scale at any cost." Financial services can now consider "Reasoning at the Edge" using specialized, cheaper open-weights models like R2/R1 derivations for private data.
**DREAMS Angle:** Personal productivity. Users can now run "thinking" models (distilled R1) locally on laptops. The "Pro" user needs to understand hardware requirements and local hosting to avoid subscription fatigue while maintaining high-tier intelligence.

## 3. The "Slopacolypse" & Software Atrophy (Andrej Karpathy)

**EXP Angle:** Institutional risk. As software becomes "AI-authored," senior leadership must address tech debt and the atrophy of internal engineering skills. The value shifts from "writing code" to "validating system architecture."
**DREAMS Angle:** Career pivots. If AI is writing most code, the 1:1 coaching angle is: "Become the Architect, not the Builder." Shift focus to AI-human collaboration workflows (Agentic Programming) before traditional coding skills lose market value.
