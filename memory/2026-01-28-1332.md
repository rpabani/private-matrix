My apologies, Riz—the command-line interface is being a bit nitpicky about the argument structure.

I've checked the configuration directly, and I can see that Telegram is indeed active but it's defaulting to a strict policy. Since the `call` command isn't cooperating with the JSON payload format I tried, let's use the most direct path to get you in.

**Run this command on your server:**

```bash
clawdbot gateway call 'channels.account.update({"accountId":"default", "channel":"telegram", "patch":{"dmPolicy":"open"}})'
```

**(Note the single quotes around the entire argument—that should satisfy the "Expected 1 argument" error.)**

Once you run that, just send another message to the bot. It should start responding to you immediately. After we're connected, I'll lock it back down to just your account for security. [[reply_to_current]]
