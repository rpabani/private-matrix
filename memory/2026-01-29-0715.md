## Conversation Summary

assistant: I just pushed everything to the repository. 

That includes your identity files, our session memories, and the SEO audits. You should see them on GitHub now in the `private-matrix` repo. 🕶️

Anything else on the technical side, or should we look at those audits?

[message_id: 430]
assistant: I've analyzed both audits. Since you want to keep the Linear backlog lean, I recommend these 4 high-impact actions. They focus on turning these sites from "online brochures" into "customer funnels."

### 1. **Rewrite Meta Tags for Exponential Partners**
*   **The Issue:** Your current tags are generic and don't mention "AI" or "Venture Studio."
*   **Action:** Update the Title and Meta Description to include your core keywords. This is a 10-minute fix that 10x's your search visibility.

### 2. **Create Tool-Specific Landing Pages for Dreams AI Can Buy**
*   **The Issue:** People don't search for "AI coaching" as much as they search for "ChatGPT training London" or "How to use Claude for my business."
*   **Action:** Add 2-3 short sub-pages or sections targeting specific tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Midjourney).

### 3. **Verify Google Business Profile (Local SEO)**
*   **The Issue:** Dreams is perfectly set up for London, but without a verified Google Business listing, you won't show up in the "Map Pack" when people search "AI coach near me."
*   **Action:** Ensure the Google Business Profile is verified and matches your schema.

### 4. **Add Social Proof & USP to Both**
*   **The Issue:** Great design, but no testimonials or clear "Why us?" (e.g., the 90-minute session for Dreams).
*   **Action:** Add a "Testimonials" or "Companies We've Helped" section to build trust immediately.

**Should I go ahead and create these in Linear as our first "Sprint"?** I can also draft the specific Meta Tag copy for you right now if you want to update the site tonight.

[message_id: 432]
assistant: I've updated our task tracking. Here is how they are organized:

**Moved to TODO:**
1.  **Optimize Meta Tags (EP):** Rewrite Title/Meta tags for `exponentialpartners.io` to target "AI Strategy" and "Venture Building."
2.  **Tool-Specific Pages (Dreams):** Create sub-sections/pages for ChatGPT and Claude training in London.
3.  **Trust & Social Proof:** Add testimonials/client logos to both sites.

**Added to BACKLOG:**
*   **Google Business Profile:** Setup and verify local listing (Requires business address update first).

Since I shouldn't be too heavy-handed with the process, I'll keep these in our `memory/` and `docs/` for now until we decide if you want them mirrored in a specific tool like the Linear project we discussed earlier.

**Ready to knock one out?** I can draft the new Meta Tags for `exponentialpartners.io` right now so you can just copy-paste them into Vercel/Next.js.

user: [Telegram Riz (@rizhistory) id:1702782425 +43s 2026-01-28 21:57 UTC] no - i'm still in planning mode to be honest.
[message_id: 434]
assistant: Understood. Planning mode it is. No sense rushing into execution until the blueprint feels right.

Since we've got the technical foundations set and the initial audits done, what's the next piece of the puzzle you want to look at? Are we thinking about the CRM/pipeline structure next, or maybe refining the marketing funnel for the two different business tiers (Retail vs. Enterprise)?

I'm here to brain-dump with or just hold the context while you think.
