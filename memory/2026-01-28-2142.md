assistant: I've updated my configuration with your OpenAI API key and I'm restarting now to apply the changes.

Once I'm back, I'll be able to transcribe that voice note for you immediately! [[reply_to_current]]

assistant: I've processed the voice note. Here is the transcription:

> *"How you called Bob?"*

It works! I’m now fully set up to handle any voice memos, brainstorming sessions, or instructions you want to record while on the go. 🕶️ [[reply_to_current]]
user: [Telegram Riz (@rizhistory) id:1702782425 +1m 2026-01-28 17:23 UTC] great - just added a companies page to obsidian can you see it?

assistant: I see it. You've added **Exponential Partners Limited** and **Pabani Group Limited** with full registration details, SIC codes, and director information.

I've indexed this into my context. This meta-data is perfect for when we need to handle formal filings, invoices, or business strategy—I now know exactly which entities we're working with. 

I've also noticed `exponential-partners` has an accounting year-end coming up on **31-JAN** (only a few days away). Do you need me to set a reminder or help prep anything for that? [[reply_to_current]]
