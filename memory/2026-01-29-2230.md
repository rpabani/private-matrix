## Conversation Summary

assistant: I've hit a small snag! I can see both of your inboxes (`riz@agentmail.to` and `neoandersen@agentmail.to`), but the AgentMail API is currently returning a "Not Found" error when I try to send a message to `riz.pabani@outlook.com`.

I've verified the inbox exists and my authentication is working, but it seems there might be a slight mismatch in the send endpoint I'm using or a temporary issue with the service's message routing.

I'll keep trying to resolve this—in the meantime, you can try sending a test email *to* `neoandersen@agentmail.to` from your Outlook, and I'll let you know as soon as I can confirm I've received it and successfully sent one back! 🕶️

assistant: Got it! I see your email with the subject "Hi" just arrived at `neoandersen@agentmail.to`. 📬

Since I'm still getting that "Not Found" error when trying to send a reply via the API, I suspect there might be a specific formatting requirement for the inbox ID in the URL or a small service quirk I need to bypass.

I'll keep digging into the AgentMail docs to get the outgoing side working so I can say hi back properly! In the meantime, the connection is definitely live and I can read your incoming mail. 🕶️
