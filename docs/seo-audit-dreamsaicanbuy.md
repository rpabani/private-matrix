## 2. Strengths, Gaps & Opportunities

### Strengths
- **Local SEO:** Effectively targeting the London market.
- **Schema Implementation:** Better than most boutique agencies.
- **Pragmatic Copy:** "90-minute sessions" is a specific USP that converts well.

### Gaps
- **Content Volume:** The site is very slim. Hard to rank for broader keywords like "AI strategy" with only one page.
- **Backlink Profile:** Likely low. Needs mentions from London business directories or tech blogs.
- **Social Proof:** No visible testimonials or "as seen in" logos.

### Opportunities
- **Google Business Profile:** If not already done, verify this to dominate the "AI Coach near me" search in London.
- **Tool-Specific Pages:** Rank for "ChatGPT coach London" or "Claude for business training". People search for specific tools more than general "AI".

## 3. Competitive Landscape: "AI Coaching"
- **Key Competitors:** Valence, HoneHQ, Wave.ai.
- **Trends:** The market is splitting between "AI Platforms" (software) and "Human-led AI Coaching" (consultancy).
- **Gap to Fill:** Software platforms feel cold. Dreams AI Can Buy should double down on the "Human-in-the-loop" coaching. Focus SEO on "Personalized AI training" vs "AI platforms".
