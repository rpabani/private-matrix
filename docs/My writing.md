# Are AI Assistants Sycophantic?

Sycophancy is where AI models are overly agreeable. To the point where where the truth can start being lost.

For example:  
You say, “I think the Earth is flat.”  
A sycophantic model replies, “Interesting perspective…”  
Instead of: “That’s false, and here’s why.”  
  
This stems from models optimising to seem helpful rather than being truthful. 

The business incentive doesn’t help either: if you feel good, you come back.

A recent story gave me hope that we will start seeing this change very soon. 

Three OpenAI researchers trained one of their models for the 2025 International Mathematical Olympiad and it solved 5 of the 6 problems.

It won a gold medal.

What stuck with me wasn’t the achievement.

It was how it responded to problem 6.

The model thought for up to 100 minutes, burned through significant compute, and came back with: “no answer”.

That's a rare skill in AI: knowing when you don't know.

The team admitted question 6 is genuinely hard — they’d need months to figure out an approach themselves.

My basic trick when I can’t risk any hallucinations is to use an “escape hatch” in my prompt:

“If you’re under 95% confident, say so — and tell me what would raise confidence.”

It’s not perfect.

But it beats confident nonsense.

And soon, hopefully, models will just say: “I don’t know.”

# What is the best programming language… the answer may not be what you think 

Andrej Karpathy said in 2023 - the hottest new programming language is English.

  
Let me explain:

  

Typically you would need to understand programming languages (like Python, Java) and frameworks to build websites, iOS applications and automations. 

  

However since Claude Opus 4.5 was made available through Claude Code, English is truly the language of choice.

  

Software is commoditised now. If you can describe a workflow, judge what’s useful, and have basic taste in user experience, you can get surprisingly far.

  

Plan mode in Claude Code is particularly good at helping you make design trade-offs, assess infrastructure options, and handle security and authentication.

  

Over the last six months I’ve built 20+ applications and internal tools, and helped numerous individuals and businesses prototype with AI. 

  

We’ve hit an inflection point: more people can now build what they need without spending weeks learning to code.

  

Which is why I’ve added co-building sessions to [Dreams AI Can Buy](https://www.linkedin.com/company/dreams-ai-can-buy/) for 2026.

  

Want to build your first iPhone app, landing page, or dashboard — with a guide who’s already made the mistakes before? Book directly from my site or drop me a message.

  

You keep the code, agent chat logs, recording, and transcript we produce during the session.

  

And if you want to take something to production, [Exponential Partners](https://www.linkedin.com/company/exponential-partners-io/) can support it with full design and engineering support.

  

# Who has an incompetent colleague who should've been replaced by AI ages ago? 

We've all got them or had them: the ones who seem perpetually average (or worse), yet somehow stick around forever.

You'd think AI would make them redundant first. But no, the truth is that the incompetent colleague still has more context than AI will have for some time..

For example, in real life workplaces, often the real "skill" isn't execution — it's mastering the invisible, undocumented stuff AI still can't yet touch.

Things like:

- Reading the room on a Zoom call: sensing tension before anyone speaks, decoding the boss's "that's interesting" as code for "drop this now," or knowing when a joke is funny vs. passive-aggressive. AI sees transcripts; humans feel the vibe.
    
- "Urgent" meaning 500 different things: Sarah = next week; Mike = cancel your life.
    
- Knowing who actually calls the shots (spoiler: not always the org chart).
    
- When to CC someone just to cover your arse.
    
- Navigating conflicting priorities and clashing egos,. 
    

So whilst we can label colleagues as being "lazy/slow/incompetent"... they still have access to the invisible human context-navigation — the unwritten rules, political landmines, and tacit knowledge no one bothers (or can) fully document.

Most workplaces are still too vague, political, and human for complete automation.

Tag your most "irreplaceable" colleague in the comments... (kidding... or am I? 👀)

  

# What Does Socrates Have to Do with ChatGPT?

Socrates, the 5th-century BC philosopher, is famous for a technique called the socratic method. It’s a method of asking disciplined, thoughtful questions to stimulate critical thinking and uncover deep truths—rather than just handing someone the answer.

Most people use ChatGPT or Gemini to get the answer now. But they are overlooking one of the most powerful features: Study Mode (or Guided Learning). This mode essentially programs the AI to act like Socrates.

I recently experienced this while reading Richard Feynman's Six Easy Pieces.

Feynman is a brilliant physicist, and while the book is written for beginners, I have to admit—I got completely stuck. specifically on the chapter about the Conservation of Energy.

Feynman uses a "see-saw" thought experiment to explain the difference between Real Machines (irreversible) and Ideal Machines (reversible). I read the page three times. I was still lost.

So, instead of asking AI "What does this mean?", I turned on Guided Learning.

The AI didn't just dump a summary on me. It started a conversation.

1. It explained the "Golden Rule of Mechanics."
    
2. It asked me probing questions to check my understanding.
    
3. When I failed to answer (because I was still clueless), it didn't just repeat itself. It pivoted.
    

It realized the physics jargon wasn't landing, so it switched to a Finance Analogy:

- Real Machine: Like trading $100 for Euros and back again. The bank charges a fee every time. Do this enough, and you lose money. (This is Friction).
    
- Ideal Machine: A magical bank with zero fees. You trade $100 back and forth forever and never lose a cent. (This is Reversibility).
    

Suddenly, the physics clicked.

If you are using AI just to do your work for you, you aren't learning. But if you use it as a Socratic Tutor, you can go down some incredible rabbit holes and actually understand complex topics.

Next time you're stuck, don't ask for the answer. Ask it to teach you.
