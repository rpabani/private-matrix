# Preliminary SEO Audit: exponentialpartners.io

## 1. Technical Performance & Meta Tags
- **Performance:** Hosted on Vercel. Fast TTFB (Time to First Byte). Image optimisation via Next.js `/_next/image` is good for mobile speed.
- **Title Tag:** `Exponential Partners | Home` - Service-neutral. Needs more descriptive keywords (e.g., "AI Strategy & Venture Building").
- **Meta Description:** `Welcome to Exponential Partners. Discover how we can help you grow.` - Too generic. No mention of AI, transformation, or specific industries.
- **Structure:** 
  - Uses `<h1>` for the main hero text. 
  - Clear sectioning with IDs (`#what-we-do`, `#team`).
  - Lacks a dedicated blog/insights structure on the homepage to feed internal linking.

## 2. Strengths, Gaps & Opportunities

### Strengths
- **Clean UI/UX:** High professional trust.
- **Team Authority:** Strong bios for Riz, Sacha, and others build E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness).
- **Service Clarity:** Clear differentiation between Training, Transformation, and Product development.

### Gaps
- **Keyword Targeting:** The site talks about "what" they do but doesn't use the language people search for. "AI Transformation" is good, but "AI Venture Studio" or "AI Consulting for Financial Services" are missing from key tags.
- **Content Depth:** No case studies or long-form insights visible on the landing page (though an 'Insights' link exists).
- **Internal Linking:** Very few links between services.

### Opportunities
- **Landing Pages:** Create specific pages for the target verticals (Healthcare, Finance) to capture "AI in Finance consulting" traffic.
- **Dynamic Content:** Shift 'Insights' to the homepage to show active thought leadership.

## 3. Competitive Landscape: "AI Venture Building"
- **Key Competitors:** Nuivio, AIVB.ai, High Alpha.
- **Trends:** Competitors are ranking for "Venture Studio for AI" and "Enterprise AI Innovation".
- **Gap to Fill:** Most venture builders look like VC firms. Exponential Partners has a "hands-on execution" edge—this should be the focus of the SEO copy. Use terms like "AI Product Roadmapping" and "Fractional AI CTO".
