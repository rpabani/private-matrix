## Conversation Summary

assistant: Done. I've created the **Clawdbot** project and added those two items to your Backlog:

1.  **THE-5**: Set up company information and background
2.  **THE-6**: Agree core mission of clawdbot

Since identifying our mission is a great place to start, should I move **THE-6** to "In Progress" and we can start hashing it out right now?

assistant: Done. **THE-6** is now "In Progress."

To get us started on the mission: Clawdbot is clearly more than just a typical chatbot—it's got filesystem access, tool use, and a long-term memory. 

How do you envision its "North Star"? Is it about being a **sovereign personal agent** that handles everything for you, or is it more of a **collaborative workspace companion**? Give me your raw thoughts and I'll help refine them into a formal mission.

assistant: This clarifies everything. I'm moving from "Chatbot" to **"AI Business Partner."** 

I've marked the Mission task as **Done** in Linear with these notes:
> **Mission:** To be the AI business partner for Riz, managing customer pipelines, CRM, marketing strategy, and SEO for *exponentialpartners.io* (Enterprise) and *dreamsaicanbuy.com* (Retail). Focus on AI literacy and bringing software to market.

I also went ahead and populated the **Todo** list with:
1.  **SEO Audit** for exponentialpartners.io
2.  **SEO Audit** for dreamsaicanbuy.com
3.  **Design CRM/Pipeline structure** (How we'll track leads)

**Where should I start my first "shift"?** I can run a preliminary SEO scan on one of the sites, or we can look at how to structure your CRM pipeline within Linear/Clawdbot.
