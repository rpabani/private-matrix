user: [Telegram Riz (@rizhistory) id:1702782425 +3s 2026-01-28 13:36 UTC] how do we connect you to obsidian?
[message_id: 356]
assistant: To connect to Obsidian, I use the `obsidian-cli` alongside the Local REST API plugin. Here's how we get it set up:

1.  **In Obsidian**: Install and enable the **Local REST API** community plugin.
2.  **Get your Token**: In the plugin settings, generate or copy the API Key.
3.  **Setup CLI**: I'll need to install and configure `obsidian-cli` here on the server.

Since I'm running in a sandboxed environment, I can try to install the CLI tool for you. Should I go ahead and try to install it now, or do you want to get the plugin ready in Obsidian first? [[reply_to_current]]
